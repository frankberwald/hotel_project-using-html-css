This project is a basic website with 3 pages, the home page, about page and contact page.
Its my first project in front end using HTML and some CSS elements.
I'll be uploading soon a new version of the same website with more responsive elements.

There are 3 more projects that i'll be doing with HTML and CSS, i want to include some SASS too in the future.

My current teacher in HTML and CSS is Brad Traversy from Traversy Media on Udemy, first contact with html, im finding the contents teached by Brad really fun and interesting.
